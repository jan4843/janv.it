title: “NightShift” on Apple TV
---

I don’t actually know if using NightShift brings me any real benefit, but I enable it anyway on iOS and macOS because once you get used to it, it’s difficult to go back to the blue light during the night.  
However, the device I use before going to bed is my Apple TV and there is no NightShift there.

The function is probably not there by design since you are not supposed to watch your movies with a yellow tint on them, but digging around tvOS settings I found a way to obtain a similar effect to NightShift and I tought I might share it anyway.

To enable the yellowish filter go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Display Accomodation > Color Filter, enable Color Tint, set the color to something between yellow and orange and adjust the intensity.

(Enabling the ‘Light Sensitivity’ option achieve a similar result, but also dims the image a bit.)

Since it’s not possible to schedule the filter to activate/deactivate at a certain times of the day or at sunrise/sunset like on iOS and macOS, it would be a bit tedious to go deep into settings to toggle it. Luckily, it’s possible to activate an accessibility shortcut that allows you to toggle the filter with a triple-click of the Menu button from anywhere in tvOS.  
The setting is available in Settings > General Accessability > Accessibility Shortcut.

Enjoy your yellow*er* screen.
